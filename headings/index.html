<h2> A Place I'd Like To Visit </h2>

<p> A place that I would like to visit is Seoul, South Korea. I'd want to go here because I am interested in
eastern Asian countries, but I am particularly interested in the deeply rooted traditions in Korea, as well as the
contemporary culture there. They also have amazing food!</p>

<h2> A Person I Admire </h2>
